# Creative Applications of Deep Learning

This repository contains my work while I was taking this MOOC. 

## Disclaimer:
Be aware of the Kadenze code of conduct if you are enrolled in the course. 
Do not copy the code as it is. If you've put efforts from your side and still are not able to write any piece of code, then you can refer to the notebooks here.

## Overview:
The course's [website](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-iv) is enough to give an overview of the course.

## Purpose:
There are significantly two reasons why I'm uploading my work:
1. While taking the course, I've delved into the concepts to understand them in detail. That's why I've added extra information in my notebooks that I found on the internet related to the topics which required more study.
2. Although the course was targeted for beginners, I observed that some people struggled a bit while writing code. The discussion forum of the course is very supportive but there are some basic things that need to be tweaked on the student side (something that I had to do). Therefore I'd accept issues requests from people who are facing any problems regarding the codes.

## Installation and setup

You can find the installation instruction on the [CADL repository](https://github.com/pkmital/CADL#what-is-notebook).

## Doubts:
For any doubts regarding this MOOC and the codes, post an issue and we'll clear it out.
